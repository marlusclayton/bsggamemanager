BSG Game Manager
================

This is a project for folks administering a play by forum game of the Battlestar Galactica board game.  It is still a work in progress and not fit for general consumption now.

When it's complete, the application will keep track of all aspects of the board game including player's skill cards and current loyalty, crisis cards, ships, jump track and all other elements of the BSG board game.  The application will also output state and other information according to user entered templates.  All game elements (characters, cards, etc) will be loaded from crafted XML files so end users will be able to add their own characters, crisis cards and even locations on the board to use.

Compiling:
 - Clone this repo
 - cd in
 - mvn clean compile assembly:single
 - the above command will build a JAR containing all dependencies in the target/ directory
 
The config/ directory must be in running directory when launching the app

Work left to do:

-General bug fixes
-Ships
-Saving (*gulp*)
